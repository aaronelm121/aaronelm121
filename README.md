- 👋 Hi, I’m @aaronelm121
- 👀 I’m interested in music, reading, learning new things, and gaming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics. I am looking up terminology and starting with CodeAcademy before moving over to The Odin Project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing much at the moment as I am still a beginner.
